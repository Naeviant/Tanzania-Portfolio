                            <p>So far, the going has been a little tough. Although the coach to Heathrow wasn’t particularly boring, I just could not sleep. We arrived at the airport at 5:30am and had a six hour wait. This gave us time to clear baggage and security and to get some breakfast – but it was still a long time. I managed just 20 minutes of sleep at the airport.</p>
                            <p>My first flight went well and I actually rather enjoyed it. However, I did not sleep for the entire four-hour flight. At least the food was better than expected! After another hour or two’s wait, we got on the second flight. I still struggled to sleep and started to really miss family and friends, most notably ***, who I really could have done with at the time. Eventually, after getting comfortable and having some painkillers to get rid of the headache from lack of sleep, I managed to finally rest. I went for 35 hours on just 20 minutes sleep.</p>
                            <p>When we arrived in Tanzania, it turned out the majority of our hold luggage hadn’t made it – including mine – and so I was missing several things I would have liked. We took a coach from the airport to a nearby hotel. As much as I tried to stay awake, I just couldn’t. So, when we arrived and had breakfast (chips and doughballs), I went for a sleep until dinner (pasta with fruit).</p>
                            <p>As much as it was a shaky start, the Tanzanian setting has certainly lifted spirits. This afternoon we’re going for a walk around the area and I’m hoping to get some good pictures, before getting a well-deserved sleep.</p>
                            <h5>9:30pm</h5>
                            <p>This afternoon has proved to be far more successful. We made a trip to the local supermarket for anything we didn’t have because of the luggage error. I didn’t really need anything, but did find a huge slice of rainbow cake for just 5000 shillings! We then went souvenir shopping at a local market, although there was nothing I particularly fancied.</p>
                            <p>After briefly returning to the hotel, we walked to a local primary school where we will soon be doing some work. On the way there and back, everyone was so friendly. Children were coming out of their houses to say hello and wave. Three children stopped on their way home and gave each of us a high-five.</p>
                            <p>On the way back from the hotel, Bayley said that it is nicer than in Ashton and, in some ways, he has a point. Despite many of them having less than us, they’re really happy. It puts into perspective when people back at home complain about literally anything. At tea, a good point was made by Ian that there are people nearby who do not have enough food. It gives a new look on the saying “there are people starving in Africa, so eat your food”.</p>
                            <p>Tea was nice. We had soup for starters (which I didn’t have). We then had lamb and vegetables for a main and fruit for dessert. Finally, I spent the evening playing cards with the other Year 12s, which was a good laugh. Tomorrow, we’re going to our first camp and starting our project work. Also, our luggage should arrive in the morning. Now hopefully I can get my body clock fixed!</p>

                            <h5>9pm</h5>
                            <p>Today started off rather alarmingly as I mistook the sound of Mr Carty knocking on our door for the sound of me being shot at. I also had a brief moment thinking “where am I?”. Breakfast today was cereal with various fruit sides.</p>
                            <p>After breakfast, we packed up and headed off to the airport to collect our hold luggage. Thankfully, it had been located having been left in Turkey. Once that had been taken care of, we headed off to our next camp, only for the bus to break down due to a flat battery (repeatedly). Once we had changed buses, the journey turned out to be very pleasant. One of the lads had a Bluetooth speaker and so we spent the time singing along and taking pictures of the local area.</p>
                            <p>When we arrived at camp, we were given a brief introduction before being served dinner: spaghetti. This camp is much more basic and in the middle of nowhere. We will be sleeping in tents and there are no flushing toilets or flowing showers. It does, however, have a large variety of wildlife and some beautiful surroundings and so I spent some time walking around taking pictures.</p>
                            <p>We also had our first project this afternoon – making elephant dung paper (EDP). There are several steps to this:</p>
                            <ul class="browser-default">
                                <li>Boil the dung to remove bacteria.</li>
                                <li>Remove any large sticks from the boiled dung.</li>
                                <li>Grind up the dung and mix it with waste paper dissolved in water.</li>
                                <li>Rub the mixture into a bowl of water.</li>
                                <li>Dip a template into the water and remove it. Then place the mixture on the template to dry.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The EDP is used to save elephants from poaching by making them a useful asset in the community. The local people can also sell them on for profit.</p>
                            <p>We then returned to camp for some downtime. I spent it having a little rest in the tent. For the first time since leaving the flight, I started missing home. Later on, I tried one of the toilets. It’s not the easiest to use, but it’s not as bad as I thought. A chart is provided to show how hydrated you are based on the colour of your wee, and it’s looking like I’m getting enough water! I was hoping for a shower, but unfortunately the water is running dirty, so I’m hoping for an improvement tomorrow. Before sitting down for tea, Mr Lawton showed me his magic trick (which I instantly poked flaws in). He also introduced me to a card game called Spit, which is difficult but fun. It goes without saying, I didn’t win.</p>
                            <p>We then settled down for tea, where we had beef and rice. It was <em>really</em> nice. The food has exceeded all expectations so far. The only downside was the moth landing in my food. A few of us sat down to play Cheat after dinner, before I went to my tent to sort my things out for tomorrow. We’re doing a three hour walk tomorrow, so I’ve got my boots out (right from the bottom of the bag!) and some other useful things. Hopefully, I can get a bucket shower in and I’m starting to need to wash clothes, but this camp is too dirty. For now, though, I’m just hoping for a good sleep.</p>

                            <h5>1:30pm</h5>
                            <p>Last night wasn’t a particularly good night. Given how hot it was when I went to bed, I thought I wouldn’t need a sleeping bag. But, the lack of clouds made it turn cold very quickly. I managed to get into my sleeping bag in the dark, albeit upside down. At least it kept me warm. I also had the worst cramp ever and was attacked by a mosquito. But, despite all of this, I did get some sleep and, so far, am not tired. Breakfast this morning was more cereal. Sadly, though, there were only hot drinks so I had a cup of milk, which ended up being warm and not very nice.</p>
                            <p>The activity this morning was having a long walk to the waterhole to have a look at the wildlife. I’ve seen water hogs, zebras, giraffes and more. As much as I took lots of pictures, it’s difficult to get good ones because of the distance and them running away. There were also some bones lying around of long-dead animals. The route to the waterholes takes us past several extinct volcanoes, which have thrown basalt out into the surroundings. The mountains go on for as far as you can see, but otherwise it is flat and dusty. The waterhole has a viewing platform, which really shows off this view.</p>
                            <p>My task at the waterhole was to collect rocks to form the edge of the waterhole. I initially started with single large rocks, but then went for several small rocks. The purpose of this waterhole was to give the animals somewhere to drink without having to leave the area – helping to keep them safe.</p>
                            <p>Water is a precious resource here. There is a conflict between the local tribe and animal herders because the herders’ animals take the water needed by the wild animals. We saw this when a small child was herding over 100 cattle and was chased by one of the armed rangers escorting us. It was actually quite hard to watch as the child ran away screaming as she was being chased.</p>
                            <p>What I did take away from this activity is that I’m not as strong as I’d like to be. Perhaps I’ll sign up to a gym when I get a car. Jack has offered to coach me while we’re here, so I think I’ll give that a go. We’ve just finished dinner, which was chicken with potato. The chicken was on the bone, so it wasn’t particularly for me – but it was a well needed meal.</p>
                            <h5>7:15pm</h5>
                            <p>This afternoon our first activity was basic bush skills. Our first task was to build a shelter using whatever we could find within 45 minutes. I have done this several times before, but this is the first time when I was happy with the result. Sadly, we didn’t win though! Next, we were shown how to make a fire from wood. The project officers made it look so easy, but unfortunately none of us managed to pull it off. Finally, we were shown how to use a bow and arrow and given two arrows each to hit a target. Despite having done archery before, I still missed with both.</p>
                            <p>We then walked across to the local Maasai Tribe village. Nothing I could write here would do the experience justice. The entire village came out to welcome us. Their tradition is to welcome visitors with two songs and dances. It was quite incredible to watch. Some of them took people from the crowd to join in and in the end all of us were involved. I wish I could say our songs and dances went well, but it wasn’t terribly successful. We did the Hokey Cokey, which was alright and the villagers were involved. The second, the Macarena, was a disaster. Still, at least we didn’t sing the national anthem, given that Tanzania used to be colonised by Britain.</p>
                            <p>We then had a look inside a house. It was almost complete darkness and very small. They’re made from cow poo and mud with straw roofs. The area was quite poor. The children had flies crawling on them and they weren’t phased. Some of the animals seemed extremely underweight. Despite this, everyone was so happy. Children were making games in the dust: the best example I’ve ever seen of making something out of nothing.</p>
                            <p>On the way back, Ian explained that how the village works. One man has many sons and each one marries and brings back his wife. These couples then live in a house each with their children and so everyone in the village is one family. The whole thing left me speechless.</p>
                            <p>We’re now waiting for tea, but have been told we’re leaving camp early for an additional safari tomorrow. Breakfast could be either 5:30am or 6:30am!</p>
                            <h5>9pm</h5>
                            <p>I’ve finally had a bucket shower! I nearly scolded myself but it was needed. Tea was lovely: rice and veg. Now to get an early night! </p>

                            <h5>10pm</h5>
                            <p>Last night wasn’t too bad. I did wake up fairly early and couldn’t go back to sleep because Ethan and Oscar were snoring. Apparently, I stole Oscar’s pillow in my sleep and started cuddling it. It was cereal for breakfast once again today, before we packed up and loaded the van to move on.</p>
                            <p>The trip to the safari wasn’t very eventful. We swapped into some safari jeeps and set off for our safari. Unfortunately, my camera’s battery went flat just before the safari, so I haven’t been able to take any pictures. However, some of the views were incredible. There was a huge lake that we drove around. We saw giraffes, baboons, other moneys, zebras, water hogs and more. It was surprising, but very nice, to see them all living so close together. For me, the best experience was attempting to stand in the jeep while it goes over the bumpy terrain. I was stood at the front and was continually warning everyone of incoming bumps and cambers. One of the jeeps got stuck and so we had to give it a nudge up. I’m not too disheartened about the lack of pictures because we’ll have another safari and I’ll make sure to take spare batteries.</p>
                            <p>The journey to the next camp after the safari took three hours. It gave an interesting overview of the wider area. In build up areas, every three or four shops is sponsored by Pepsi or Vodacom. Traffic laws are generally obeyed, but some people don’t wait for green lights. Police spot checks are common, but I haven’t seen any response cars. In the rural areas, there were several families herding livestock. I also saw two people practicing martial arts at the roadside. But, most notably, there were many children carrying buckets of water on their heads. It’s one thing seeing it on TV, but another thing seeing it in person. Some of them even tried hitchhiking.</p>
                            <p>We arrived at the camp and were given a brief tour. The toilets flush and the showers having running water (albeit cold). We also stay in dormitories by year group. There is a gap between the walls however, so we have Year 11s and staff on either side who hear everything. We’re also not the only group here. One group is already here and another is joining us in the morning. The group here has girls, so I thought it would be appropriate to have a wash and change clothes. Standing at the front of the jeep had caused me to get all of the dust. It looked like I had been coal mining (I even had dust in my brace) and so the wash was needed. I’ve also managed to wash my clothes. The mud is stained in some of them, but at least it won’t go onto everything else.</p>
                            <p>Tea was spaghetti, with vegetables, which was okay. Today was Miss Mason’s birthday, so she was given a cake as we sang happy birthday. The staff also used dinner plates as symbols while singing, but one of them dropped one and so the staff started randomly throwing them on the floor mid-song. It was absolutely hilarious.</p>
                            <p>In the free time, I pulled a spider out of a shower because Harry wouldn’t go in while it was there. The most notable thing was the Year 11s and Year 10s attempting to get onto the girls from the other groups. It was really irritating to watch. They were attempting to drag us into it too. I was just thinking of *** and *** back at home and would really have liked their company tonight. I would happily have a chat with the other group with the other Year 12s, but I don’t want to deal with the younger ones. There was also an incident where a pair of knickers ended up in our room, which someone threw to the Year 11s’ room. All in all, I’m in a bit of a bad mood tonight. We’re all going to get very little sleep and probably shouted at. Tomorrow we’re working on a school, which will be rewarding, so I’m trying to focus on that.</p>

                            <h5>6:15pm</h5>
                            <p>Last night was better than expected. Eventually everyone was quiet but, as a result of being next to Jack and Bayley who both snore like bears, I didn’t get a full night. But it was enough. Breakfast was a welcome change of sausage, egg and toast, although there wasn’t much of it. Once the dishes were done and my stuff was packed, we walked to our project site, about half an hour away. It was very hot under the sun, but at least my tan is starting to show! The only downside is that the effects of inhaling so much dust yesterday are starting to show as I have a really tickly throat.</p>
                            <p>Our project is at the local nursery school. The Year 10s were plastering and painting an existing building, while the rest of us begun work on a new classroom. The first thing we had to do was clear the rocks bordering the paths. We then had to use hoes and shovels to clear the grass from the building area. This was incredibly hard work, and of the most physically straining things I’ve done recently, but knowing it’s helping the kids kept me motivated. The children occasionally came out to say hi and give us high-fives.</p>
                            <p>We then walked back to camp for dinner. Today we had rice and beans. Salad was also offered, but I didn’t want any. It was pretty much immediately time to head back to the project site afterwards. When we returned, we were invited into the classroom where the children sang a song for us. It lasted for at least two minutes and was very sweet to watch. They wanted us to sing a song for them, which of course we were not prepared for. Once I’d made it clear to Miss Mason (again) that I don’t want to do a solo of the national anthem, we settled for Once I Ate A Fish Alive.</p>
                            <p>We then gave gifts for the teacher to distribute. The children were desperate to get something, crowding around the teacher. Considering the gifts were only basics like tennis balls and crayons, this was quite difficult to see, but I kept it together. That was until later on, when the children were dismissed. Some of them were coming out with as little as a crayon each, but running up to a local tuk-tuk driver (who they don’t know) and showing off their gifts with indescribable happiness. It was at this point where I had a little cry. But, freshly motivated by seeing these scenes, I continued my project work. This time, I gave the plastering a go – which went reasonably well.</p>
                            <p>We then headed back to camp again. I went immediately for a well-deserved shower. The water only runs cold, but it didn’t matter given the heat. The biggest issue is that there’s not really anyway to hang your dry clothes. When that was done, I cleaned my clothes from the project and collected the clothes I washed yesterday. I then repacked my things and settled down for a bit. Some Year 10s and 11s have invited themselves into our dorms, which is getting on my nerves a bit. Jack has, however, shown off his workout routine and even Mr Carty has been in to have a go! I’m really looking forward to tea; I need a good meal after today.</p>
                            <h5>9:45pm</h5>
                            <p>While out on the bandstand avoiding the Year 10s and 11s in my room, I decided to buy myself a pair of rainbow joggers. They’re really comfy, but I’m saving them for the journey home. Tea was pasta with beef, and the pasta was incredible. Soup was offered again, but I still haven’t had any. The party in my dorm continued after tea despite me kicking them out. In the end, another group’s leader complained about the noise and everyone was kicked out again. Also, ***’s phone has a broken screen and so he’s now in a bad mood. Tensions are running high tonight. I’m just hoping everyone sleeps it off.</p>

                            <p>Last night was similar to the one before. I woke up early again, but it was soon time to get up. Breakfast was back to cereal this morning. There was no milk so it wasn’t great. We then set off on our safari. Rather unexpectedly, we went past a "heroine shop"! It’s always quite interesting to see what’s going past on long trips.</p>
                            <p>The safari was better straight from the off because my camera had enough battery this time. I’ve actually got some good pictures for a change. Additional animals this time included water bucks, elephants and lions. While I enjoyed it, it did last a little long. The packed lunch was lovely, but I did miss the chocolate from the last one. The other problem was that the chicken was on the bone, which I’m not keen on. Miss Mason had some bad luck when a baboon stole her biscuits. On the way back, one of the jeeps broke down and so we had to have each jeep have two people sat on the floor to get everyone back (yet more great problem solving from Camps!).</p>
                            <p>When we got back, the teachers gave a talk on a collection of incidents last night in relation to comments made by some of our group to gay/lesbian/trans/autistic people from another group. It was quite powerful actually, and has really set the mood in camp for tonight.</p>
                            <h5>9pm</h5>
                            <p>I’ve been for a chat with Mr Lawton about the incident last night. Given what happened with ***, I was quite annoyed about it and it was good to get it off my chest. We settled down for tea which was rice with beef. I wasn’t keen on the way the beef was cooked, so I kept to the rice, which was as good as ever. I also sterilised my water bottles, which was probably long overdue. I’ve removed a really big spider from the room and helped Bayley to search for his antimalarials. I’m now just planning on a quiet night!</p>

                            <p>Last night was too funny to fall asleep for a while. Harry and Jacob’s reaction to Jack doing his fitness routine into the night set me off, and then being able to see ***’s shadow stood outside our room like Miss Trunchbull only made it better. I also woke up early and, due to everyone’s snoring, couldn’t get back to sleep. Breakfast this morning was Cornflakes once again. This time, at least, there was milk. Eggs, toast and sausage were served later, but I was too full for that.</p>
                            <p>We then set off to the project site. I’m sure the walk gets longer each time. Not having a way of checking the time is becoming quite irritating. When we arrived, we continued from Friday by widening the trenches and making them deeper/flat. We then began to put the larger stones to hold the foundations. My job in this was initially to remove loose dirt with a shovel, and later to flatten the stone stacks with smaller stones. I lifted some of the bigger stones, but eventually decided to leave that to the stronger ones. Again, I really think that I should sign up to a gym sometime.</p>
                            <p>We came back for dinner. Honestly, I don’t even know what it was. It was something pancake-like with beans. Whatever it was, it was nice. We then headed back to the project site again and continued from where we left off. When the stones were level, we began sorting the cement. My first job as carrying cement in buckets from the mixing area to the trench. It was really heavy. I later had a go at mixing the cement, which was really hard work. Finally, we moved some small/medium sized rocks to the middle of the site to make it easier for the next group to continue. The village chairman also came along to meet us and thank us for our efforts – which of course means a lot.</p>
                            <p>Once we were done, I took a step away from the group to take a picture of our efforts. As I walked back, three of the school children called me over I had a short chat with them and they asked for some pictures. These later turned into larger group photos. This was a really heart-warming moment, and exactly why I am on this trip. On the way back, we sang a song with our project officer. My plans for the evening are to have a shower and get packed for tomorrow. Some people are playing football later on, so that should be good opportunity for a shower. Both Ethans, Oscar and Jacob are ill, so packing may not be that easy while they try to rest. I just hope I’m not next! I’m also really looking forward to tea; the work today has really taken it out of me.</p>
                            <h5>9pm</h5>
                            <p>I’ve been for a shower and feel so much better for it. When tea came around, it was a collection of spaghetti, rice and veg. It was a nice final meal. After tea, we were given a talk about our progress. The project officer said thank you on behalf of the community and that they’d never forget us. What better compliment could we ask for? I was on washing-up duty tonight, which wasn’t ideal. Furthermore, someone from another group has thrown deodorant on a fire, so everyone is caught up in incident statements. On a better note, I have been nominated as team leader tomorrow. It should be pretty easy as it’s a travel day. Now I just need to plan a speech!</p>

                            <h5>3pm</h5>
                            <p>Last night managed to top the one before. Harry attempted to get changed in the room, only to be interrupted by Mr Carty coming in at the complete wrong time. Also, Jacob and Callum Teggart had a full conversation in parrot voices. Later on, when Mr Carty said we need to quiet down, we were still laughing and he thought we were laughing at him and so we all felt really bad. This morning we were woken up at 5:45am and got everything packed up. Breakfast was eggs, toast and sausages, and I gave the team briefing. We loaded up the bags onto the buses and set off.</p>
                            <p>It was a long and uncomfortable journey. I bought some chocolate and the driest cakes ever to keep me going. We later stopped off to exchange money for some people. While this was happening, we were hounded by people trying to sell us things. Luckily, the camp wasn’t too far away and we were given an introduction. It’s very spacious and we currently have it to ourselves. We’re also back to tents and the groupings have upset some people. We’ve been given pasta and veg for dinner, which was alright. Unfortunately, Ethan Taylor has since become ill again and I’m full of a cold. We’re going for a look around later, so hopefully I’ll see some nice things!</p>
                            <h5>9pm</h5>
                            <p>We took a brief ten-minute walk to the project site. We saw the classrooms we will be working on. One of them requires a new floor and another needs painting. We were also taught a song in one of the classrooms. The project officers here are amazing with their enthusiasm. We then came back and had some free time before tea. Tonight, we had chapatis with beans; it was really good. As team leader, I managed everyone getting their dishes cleaned without any help from staff, which I’m pretty pleased with. Unfortunately, a Year 10 has managed to demolish his tent and snap a pole.</p>
                            <p>After tea, we were given a short Swahili lesson, where we learned some basic phrases. This followed by Cha-Cha Smooth and a “traditional” African dance. I can’t wait for those videos to appear on Twitter (oh wait, I can)! Finally, as team leaders, myself and Max (the other team leader today) announced the new team leaders and star of the day. I accidentally chose a team leader who had done it before, but oh well. My cold is now starting to go away, but I now have a really bad shoulder. I’m also considering presents now and things to do when I get home. There was a pair of elephant joggers I’m considering getting. I really need to think about who else I’m buying for...</p>

                            <h5>8:30am</h5>
                            <p>Last night was an improvement now that we’re back in the tents. Once we’d finished chatting around 11pm, I actually got a good night’s sleep. I was practicing the Jambo song in my dream last night, rather bizarrely, until I was woken up by the birds around 5:30am. Breakfast this morning was back to Cornflakes. I didn’t fancy the alternative of hard-boiled eggs. I’m all packed up and ready to start on the project. I’m hoping for a fairly easy job because of my shoulder problems. But first, I’m just going to get some pictures of the new camp before we go.</p>
                            <h5>1pm</h5>
                            <p>We walked down to the project site and were immediately greeted by loads of children. There are 800 students with 24 teachers. I was initially hesitant to get involved, but when I did there were many high-fives. Some of them wanted pictures (I’ve got an absolutely brilliant one) and one of them even took my hand off my bottle because they wanted to hold it. While waiting for a picture, one of them kissed me on the cheek too. It really is nice to know that we’re appreciated here.</p>
                            <p>Given my shoulder problems, I was doing painting this morning. We gave a classroom a new coat of paint and gave it some time to dry, before putting a second coat on. Finally, we drew out the borders for the skirting. It was much less tiring than the last project. The only downside to it was that it took us a while to get going.</p>
                            <p>Dinner has just been served. Today we had spaghetti with vegetables. It was alright I suppose. Some fish and chips would be nice about now! We’ve had a few rounds of Cards Against Humanity and I’m just going to work on some fitness exercises while we wait to go back out to the project site again. The good news is that my cold is really clearing up now.</p>
                            <h5>5pm</h5>
                            <p>I decided to change jobs at the project this afternoon. My main job has been trying to get the floor level, which required hitting the concrete with a hammer until it turned to dust. My idea was to pretend the floor was someone we didn’t like to motivate ourselves. Everything assumed I was thinking of ***, but I was actually thinking of ***. It worked very effectively though! Jack and Ethan both had issues moving a bit and I got it first try. We’ve made good progress today as a team. I’ve ended up an absolute mess again somehow, so I’ll be having a shower later. I’m also considering buying some more joggers from the camp shop. I’m still thinking about presents too. We’re having an R+R day on Sunday, so I’m hoping to do some shopping then.</p>
                            <p>The thing that has struck me the most today is the schoolchildren. Some of them wrote <em>really</em> kind letters to some of the other lads who spent time with them. Tomorrow I’m going to try to spend some more time with them, as I didn’t really do that much today. I’d love it if I got a letter. Not only would it be a good souvenir, but it’s a new friend and another sign of their appreciation of our work. The children followed us from the school all the way back to camp. On the other side, one of the children was eating some polystyrene packaging before Mr Lawton stopped him. It was quite a sad sight to see, especially considering that the boy seemed upset that the packaging had been taken away.</p>
                            <h5>8:30pm</h5>
                            <p>I managed to get a shower, but unfortunately there was still no hot water. I’ve bought myself some elephant joggers and a matching shirt. I’ve requested that more rainbow joggers are brought in because I’ll get a pair for Jacob as a present. The only problem I see is I’m running low on cash. I’m going to take some from my volunteering permit cash, but it’s currently locked at Keys so I don’t know when I can get it.</p>
                            <p>My prayers were answered tonight at tea as we were given fish with our rice and veg! I was even served an extra piece for some reason. After tea, we had a little pull-up competition. I had a go and managed two. It’s not too bad for a first go, but I’d like to do better, I’m still doing press-ups and other exercise when possible. We were also asked to volunteer to teach the kids on Friday. I’ve put my name down since I’ve done something similar before. We’ll be running revision classes for 5-10 minutes. I’m hoping I’ll be doing maths. Given what was on the board in the classroom today, it’s pretty advanced stuff for their age. I’m looking forward to it! I’m definitely ready for a good night’s sleep after today’s work.</p>

                            <h5>1pm</h5>
                            <p>This morning I was woken up by some bells in the distance. Ian thinks it was a church somewhere. Whatever it was, it lasted about ten minutes. It then set loads of nearby dogs barking and there was some distant chanting gradually getting closer. The whole experience was a little frightening. Breakfast this morning was Cornflakes again. Then, we headed out to the project site. I decided to stick with the flooring team to carry on from yesterday. My first job was carrying buckets of sand to the room to be mixed into concrete. I then did some mixing before moving to getting the new layer smooth. It looks easy, but it’s really hard work. I’ve managed to solve my shoulder problem, but now my back really hurts.</p>
                            <p>I don’t know what it is about today, but I’m just not feeling it. I’ve really missed home today, and don’t feel particularly motivated. I did try spending some time with the kids today, but I really didn’t feel up for it I also keep going dizzy occasionally. I’m not going to give in though; I’ll be back to it later. Dinner today was sausages and mash. It was nice, but I really didn’t have much of an appetite. I’m going to try and get some rest in before going back out.</p>
                            <h5>4:30pm</h5>
                            <p>This afternoon at project was much more successful than this morning. Having downed another litre of water, I felt much more motivated. I stuck with the flooring team and carried on doing more of the same jobs. I also used a big wooden beam to flatten what we’d put down. I tried interacting with the kids more. I lifted one of them onto a higher area, and suddenly all of them wanted to be up there! I’ve still not had a letter, but that might be a good thing considering some of the lads who got them are being pestered for gifts.</p>
                            <p>It became apparent today that some of the children are caned at this school, and that has left some of us conflicted about working there. My view is that although it’s wrong, we’re helping the kids and not the school itself. Similarly, while some people are spending lots of time with the kids and getting letters and pictures, we’ll be gone after Saturday. As much as the letters say they won’t forget us, another team will be in next week and it’ll repeat. I’d much rather work on something much more permanent. Tonight, I need to have another shower and work out what clothes I need to get washed. I’m also still a bit stuck for present ideas!</p>
                            <h5>9:30pm</h5>
                            <p>Soup is being served again as a starter before tea, but I’m still not having any. The main course was spaghetti bolognaise. The meat was a little too crushed, but it was quite nice. I’ve bought a set of rainbow joggers for Jacob. I think I’m keeping that guy in business right now!</p>
                            <p>I also appear to have accidentally signed up to be a leader in a campaign against the kids here being caned – not that I’m complaining of course. Our plan is to gather the support of both groups currently at this camp and back at home construct a letter to Camps about the issue. We’d like teachers from British schools to show teachers here how to deal with classroom discipline in other ways. Hopefully, this will discourage it from continuing and hopefully it will stop completely. I’ll be talking to our group tomorrow to gain support.</p>
                            <p>I spent most of tonight getting to know some people from the other group. Considering the incident last week, it’s going quite well. We had a big group singalong before bed. I’ve managed to get a shower and sort my washing out. I appear to be missing some underwear, but otherwise it’s sorted. I’ve been complimented many times tonight for my shirt – looks like I picked a good night for it!</p>

                            <p>Despite us being given a lie in this morning, I still woke up early again because of the bells. Also, Mr Carty came over to check on us because he thought someone from another group was with us. Plus, a very big and loud helicopter went over. Breakfast this morning was Cornflakes again, and then we headed out to a local village for our culture day.</p>
                            <p>We started out by uprooting some plants to feed the cow. This cow was alone in a little room, tied to a central post. Apparently, it has always lived like this, which was sad to see. Next, we began collecting bean pods, before taking them elsewhere to pick the individual beans out. They came in a variety of colours and there ended up being loads of them. We then did some songs and I was chosen to mix some food they had prepared for us. It was a mix of banana and beef. Interestingly, the banana tasted more like a potato. The beef appeared undercooked, so I opted not to risk it.</p>
                            <p>When we came back, we found it was chicken and chips for dinner! Again, the chicken was on the bone but I made do. I ended up getting seconds of the chips; they were so good. I’ve also managed to get a full dry bag of clothes washed for 10,000TZS, which solves my clothes problem. This afternoon is turning pretty hot, so hopefully it dries quickly. This afternoon we’re going to the school again to play sports with the kids. I’m hoping for rounders or something else I can actually do.</p>
                            <h5>5pm</h5>
                            <p>We headed out to the school and went straight into one of the classrooms. There were about 90 kids all in this one class. They were all singing as we went in. When they were finished, they wanted us to sing a song for them. I never thought I’d see the day when I would be singing Country Roads to a class of African children, but today it came. We then began giving out the gifts, which of course was a touching moment.</p>
                            <p>We then went to the field to do some sports. The games on were football (England won on penalties), rugby and rounders. I went for rounders, which was interesting. It ended up as what we named “Tanzanian Rounders”. The rules are derived from a complete loss in translation between us and them. There was absolutely no running from the people batting. It appeared to be a competition of who could hit the ball the furthest. Other interesting features include:</p>
                            <ul class="browser-default">
                                <li>The direction of the batting queue changes at random.</li>
                                <li>The playing area randomly moves to the right occasionally.</li>
                                <li>The angle of the playing area gradually turns clockwise.</li>
                                <li>The number of fielders randomly changes.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The children seemed to enjoy it though, which is the important thing. It was a really moving experience. I have, unfortunately, gotten my nice shirt dirty so will attempt to wash it properly later. I also need to change the bedding. Given the state of the tent, that could be challenging...</p>
                            <h5>9:30pm</h5>
                            <p>Tea tonight was rice with lentils. We all thought it was sweetcorn, but in reality, it wasn’t very nice to be honest. We also opted to not launch the anti-caning petition today and will wait until we’ve sorted some of the finer details. We’ve been asked to compete in a talent competition in a few days, but I don’t have any ideas on what to do. Otherwise, very little happened tonight. Tomorrow, I’m doing some teaching, but otherwise it’s back to project work.</p>

                            <p>Last night got off to a bad start when a loud bird kept everyone from going to sleep. When I did get to sleep, the bells woke me up early again. It was cereal for breakfast once more, and then we headed out on project. The other group had done some work on the floor, but hadn’t done a very good job.</p>
                            <p>We began a new mix, but I got called away to do teaching. We had a bit of a problem because we couldn’t find the class teacher. However, we just carried on regardless, and it actually went quite well. My role was to do the writing on the chalk board. The kids were really good at the questions and had them done in no time. We went through the answers and then taught them to sing “Once I Caught A Fish Alive” and to do the actions. We did it a few times until they got the hang of it. The teacher then came back and the class performed it for her. We then went back to our project work and now have finished the floor.</p>
                            <p>Dinner was served pretty quickly when we got back to camp. It was spaghetti with veg today. I wasn’t keen on the veg, so just had the spaghetti. I then came back to the tent and drafted up the title and statement for the anti-caning petition with Ethan Taylor. We’re now waiting to go back out. Tempers are starting to go now that we’ve all been together for so long. *** is staying back for the day because of his mental state. I think we need a camp change soon.</p>
                            <h5>6:30pm</h5>
                            <p>This afternoon I started off by putting up some posters in a classroom. It was the same room that I painted and taught in, and it was nice to see the job through. Ethan Green left a message on the board, which one of the children tried to copy out. It was quite sweet to watch. I was then reassigned to painting a room, which I wasn’t particularly keen on. But I gave it a good go.</p>
                            <p>We then headed back to camp. The big surprise today is that it has been raining – typical considering I had almost all of my clothes on the washing line! Back at camp, I had a shower which, unsurprisingly, was cold again. Myself and Ethan Taylor then finalised the anti-caning petition. Having discussed it with Mr Carty, Ian, Tim, Chris (a teacher from the other group) and Nick (the leader from the other group), we’re happy to go ahead. Mr Lawton is hosting a quiz tonight for the whole camp, so we have decided we will launch it then. Our quiz team is sorted out and I’m feeling confident for it. I’ve also now repacked everything and tidied my side of the tent having hastily thrown my clothes in because of the rain.</p>
                            <h5>9:30pm</h5>
                            <p>Tea tonight was rice with beef. It was nice, but a little bland. Afterwards, we got straight into Mr Lawton’s House of Games. Our team name was Six Whites and a Pietsch – which was me, Jack, Oliver, Oscar, Ethan Taylor, Bayley and Charlie (from the other group). After the teachers were disqualified for cheating, we won.</p>
                            <p>Once the quiz was done with, myself and Ethan Taylor pitched the petition to both groups in the camp, and got a very positive response. I’ve felt drunk with tiredness tonight, so the speech went well considering. We’re all going to sleep in high spirits tonight!</p>

                            <h5>6:30pm</h5>
                            <p>Last night we had a deep chat within the tent to let everyone get their problems off their chest. It was definitely needed and we felt much better for it. I woke up early (again) and we went to get breakfast. I had Cornflakes (again), and decided to go for a cup of milk. I did make the mistake of not checking if it was full-fat, and it was. It wasn’t a nice drink. We went for a quick walk because there was a clear view of Kilimanjaro. It was a really beautiful sight. Apparently, we’re the first group to see it properly – so we’re lucky in that respect.</p>
                            <p>We then headed out to the project site. Today, my job was to redo the kitchen floor. This included bringing up what is left of the existing floor by striking it with a hammer. I made two major errors here. The first was that I forgot to change into my boots and still had my trainers on. The second mistake was that I forgot to wear my gloves and got a blister on my right hand. The state of the kitchen was quite shocking. I attempted to take some pictures, but dust particles from the surroundings obstructed the image. Also, patches of the floor came up by simply lifting it with a trowel. Once the floor was (mostly) removed, we began mixing concrete for the new floor. We managed to get enough to do a corner of the room.</p>
                            <p>We then returned to camp to get dinner. Today we had potato with an omelette (containing veg). It wasn’t great, but also wasn’t terrible. I was so tired after the project work and so went to rest in my tent for a bit. Before we went back out to the project, we were given the menu for our meal out tomorrow. There was so much to choose from and it was hard to narrow it down. I’ve settled for a chicken cheeseburger. The dessert was much harder to choose, so hard that Bayley and I have agreed to order four between us and go halves (chocolate cake, chocolate cheesecake, chocolate brownie and chocolate mousse). I’m really excited for that.</p>
                            <p>We then went out for what would be the last project session at this camp. I continued to work on the floor in the kitchen. Unfortunately, my leg was playing up and I found it really hard to do. Anyway, we managed to get it all completed. I took a few minutes to take some pictures of our work before we had a big group picture. We then came back to camp and I immediately joined the shower queue. There were three people in front, but it was worth the wait as it was actually warm! After my shower, I did some washing and repacked my bags ahead of us leaving on Monday. I put a plaster on my blister and then realised I’d lost the cable for my MP3 player. I couldn’t find it anywhere, and was just about to give up when Bayley found it. He’s just been in to check on me since I’m sat alone; what a nice thing to do!</p>
                            <h5>9pm</h5>
                            <p>Tea tonight was chapatis with chicken and veg. There were no knives by the time I got there, so I attempted to eat it with two forks. The chicken was on the bone too. Overall, I wasn’t too keen. After tea, we had a campfire. I didn’t stay for long because I wasn’t into it. I did go back later to do some stargazing. The sky tonight was beautiful. Looking out into the open sky has made me miss lots of people back at home. Above all, I’m just wondering what they’re up to. Today marks halfway through the expedition. As much as I’m enjoying my time here, in some ways I’m looking forward to getting home and getting on with my usual life and seeing everyone.</p>

                            <h5>5:30pm</h5>
                            <p>Last night wasn’t particularly eventful, with the exception of another one of Mr Carty’s bedtime stories. I woke up early again this morning because of the various noises around camp. Breakfast was supposed to be at 8:30, but ended up being at 8:00 and so I was a little late. We eventually set off and started by stopping off an ATM. Of the four machines, only one of them worked, and even then, it had a transaction charge. I made the most of it and took out 250,000TZS. We then went to a nearby shop. I bought, among other things, an animal mobile for ***, which I’m pretty pleased with. I’m just a little concerned about getting it home. The only downside was the cost!</p>
                            <p>We then went to the local market and was under the impression we would be free to roam around. But after being told off for wandering away, I found that wasn’t the case! One of my biggest gripes with this trip is that I miss the independence of college trips. At nearly 18, I’d rather not have someone telling me how to cross the road – although I do get why they do it.</p>
                            <p>We then went to the café for our meal. The food was good (when it eventually came out). The logistics weren’t handled very well; everything took a while and, in some cases, never came. Of the four desserts Bayley and I ordered, only the chocolate brownie came. It was huge and absolutely lovely. I was disappointed about the others though. Also, *** made a backhanded comment about how much we’d ordered, which really got under my skin.</p>
                            <p>I don’t know what it is about today, but people are really getting on my nerves. Usual things like *** complaining about literally everything, *** saying the most random and annoying things or *** acting deliberately different to impress the other group don’t usually get to me, but today it has. On the way back, we stopped at the supermarket (but I didn’t fancy anything so stayed on the bus).</p>
                            <p>Back at camp, I just went back to my tent for some alone time. Ethan Taylor has spent some time trying to cheer me up, which of course I appreciate, but what I really needed was a bit of a cry (not that I could of course). Ian hosted a treasure hunt this afternoon. I was going to miss it because of how I felt. But I’ve not skipped anything yet and I’m not about to start now. I’m not a quitter. We came 4th and there was arguing among the team, but it was alright, I guess. I’m still not feeling great though. I’d really like one of ***’s hugs right now. Also, *** has had his hair done for his drag performance at the talent show tonight in such a way that it reminds me of ***. Now I miss her each time I see him. I’ve still not fully packed before we leave tomorrow, and there’s still the talent show later. But for now, I need some alone time before tea.</p>
                            <h5>9:30pm</h5>
                            <p>I wasn’t planning on having tea tonight, but I knew I’d end up regretting it later on. Tonight, we had rice and beef. The beef wasn’t great and I didn’t end up finishing it. In the evening briefing, I was named star of the day for my petition work – which it was nice to get recognition for.</p>
                            <p>We then went straight into the talent show. It was opened by our teachers doing an Abba tribute, which was hilarious. It then went to Ben, who did well (much to my surprise actually). It was then Tim, who we were really wanting to win. It was then the drag performance, which was actually quite good. I did, during this, get an unsolicited lap dance; it was quite something. Other acts included Jack juggling and Lewis doing deliberately out of tune singing, Lewis won in the end, which is fair because it was really funny. Also, the teachers from the other group were up and did alright (probably needed more practice). Sharon ended up dragging me onto stage to dance, which I surprisingly enjoyed. Finally, we (West Hill) all sang along to Country Roads.</p>
                            <p>I congratulated everyone involved. Sharon thanked me for getting involved. She said she thought I’m eloquent speaker and therefore and eloquent dancer. Not sure I agree with that! Miss Largey also pulled me aside and said well done for not freaking out at the lap dance. Overall, it was a good night and I feel much better after earlier!</p>

                            <h5>10am</h5>
                            <p>Last night and this morning weren’t particularly eventful. I got the rest of my things packed up and then we left. The journey to the next camp wasn’t far – about 30 minutes. It was quite entertaining though. The road was continually turning and going up. At one point, we looked out at one side and saw what was a fairly big drop, and then looked on my side and were right on the edge of a cliff! I have to be honest, I’m not too keen on the new camp. I’m in a room of 16 people, the majority of which are Year 10s. It’s quite cold, which is a welcome change, but apparently it rains quite a lot, which is never helpful. I’m also starting to struggle packing. At Keys, I’m going to have a bit of a challenge getting it all ready for the flight. I’m not looking forward to it.</p>
                            <p>Today is Jacob’s birthday, and I’m a bit conflicted about phoning home. If I could be certain it’d go to voicemail, I would leave a message. I just think I’d end up getting upset if I spoke to anyone. I’ll probably end up leaving it. We’re going straight into project this afternoon, but first we’re going for a look around the local area. I’m also trying to work out what to do about clothes. Because I’m constantly changing camps now, it’s very difficult to do washing. I could go for the rest of the trip without doing any, but it’s not ideal.</p>
                            <h5>2pm</h5>
                            <p>The walk around the area was hard going. The camp is 2000m above sea level, and so the path just seemed to go on forever on the way back. That said, I did see some incredible views and wildlife. I’ve been a bit careless with my sunscreen in an attempt to get a tan going. It may end in disaster, but we’ll see. Dinner today was spaghetti with veg. It’s getting repetitive, but the spaghetti was done so well I had seconds. The veg, on the other hand, wasn’t so nice. I’m having a bit of a low moment again – missing home, my friends, home food and more. I have mentioned it and, apparently, it’s common in the middle of these trips. It’s still not nice though. Hopefully it moves on soon.</p>
                            <h5>5pm</h5>
                            <p>The walk down to the project site is further than the last camp. When we got there, we were shown what to do. We have to fill used sugar bags with soil and then sew them shut. These are then placed together to form a stable path, as the existing path will just turn to mud when it rains and the children cannot get to school. My first role was shovelling the soil into the bags. I then couldn’t find my camera and launched a search for it. It turned out I had just put it in the wrong pocket. Of course, I didn’t admit to that and pretended to find it. At this point, someone else had taken over the shovelling and I started holding the bags open while others filled them. I then moved them elsewhere to be sewed.</p>
                            <p>Once we were finished, we put the tools away in a classroom, which was interesting to look around. We then walked back to camp and it felt a long way because of how steep the uphill bits were. Back at camp, I’ve seen myself in a big mirror for the first time in a few days. My beard is coming along nicely. Also, the lack of sun cream doesn’t seem to have gone horribly wrong, so I’ll probably do the same again tomorrow. I’m not going for a shower tonight since they’re not working apparently. I’m also still unsure on what to do about clothes. I’d like to avoid washing them until Camp Tanga at least.</p>
                            <h5>8:30pm</h5>
                            <p>This afternoon hasn’t been too bad. I stayed in the room with a few others and had quite a funny chat. The highlight was reading the possible side-effects of our anti-malarials. My favourite has to be “an excessive awareness of abnormal beating of the heart”. Others included hepatitis, hallucinations and strange dreams. Fun! We than had tea which was chips and the chewiest beef ever. The chips were nice though and I had seconds. Afterwards, Ian had an activity for us in which we wrote on a post-it note our feelings on the trip. Mine was: “Nothing I could possibly write here will do this experience justice. I’ve seen some beautiful things and some heart-breaking things. What’s for certain though is that I have no regrets about coming here” – and those are words I stand by.</p>

                            <h5>8:30am</h5>
                            <p>Last night *** had a little bit of a breakdown after the other group left, and so Jack and I spent a lot of the evening comforting him. There were several games of cards (two of which I won, for a change!). Also, Ian got a reply from Camps about the petition. Peter (the Operations Manager for Tanzania) will speak to the headteacher – so things are looking good! I slept fairly well last night and managed to not fall off the bed. This morning was <em>very</em> cold. Breakfast today was bread and omelette. It was quite nice actually. We’re now heading out on project where I believe we’re planting trees today!</p>
                            <h5>1pm</h5>
                            <p>The project work this morning ended up being more of the same, not planting trees. I spent the duration holding the bags open and moving them around. Once I got into a rhythm it wasn’t so bad. There were lots of people not putting effort in today which has annoyed me. There are also lots of arguments brewing between other people, as well as a rise in illness within camp.</p>
                            <p>The walk back was hard again. I’m starting to worry about the trek over the next few days; I don’t know if I’ll be able to do it. Dinner today was rice and veg. There’s a pattern going on and I’m missing the lack in variety. We’re now practicing poker ahead of the game we’re having tonight.</p>
                            <h5>5pm</h5>
                            <p>The project work this afternoon was planting trees. Compared to other projects, it was fairly relaxed. My first job was filling buckets with soil which was passed down to another team to sieve it. Later on, once we’d gotten enough soil, my job was to fill the little bags with the soil. The bag had no bottom and so the soil had to be very compact. The tree seeds could then be put into the bags and planted to prevent soil erosion.</p>
                            <p>The walk back to camp was even worse than this morning; it just never stops going up! I now need to have a shower and re-pack before we leave tomorrow. It’s a six-to-eight-hour journey, so I need to do it well!</p>
                            <h5>8:30pm</h5>
                            <p>I managed to get a shower in this evening. It was freezing unfortunately, but I’m used to it at this point. I’ve also got everything packed up ready for moving on, but my head torch seems to have gone missing.</p>
                            <p>Tea tonight was chapatis and baked beans, and it was quite nice. We then wrote postcards for sending home. Emotions have been running high tonight. *** and *** (that I’ve seen) have been upset from missing home. Also, there was a bit of a fight in the dorm between *** and some of the Year 10s. The consequences of it will become clear tomorrow. It’s an early breakfast tomorrow at 6am so we can make the journey to the next camp in lots of time.</p>

                            <h5>6pm</h5>
                            <p>Not much happened last night following on from the fight, and this morning we were woken up at 5:45. Breakfast was only bread today because I just didn’t fancy anything else. We then took some Jeeps to the Keys Hotel where we changed onto buses. I nearly ended up on a bus to the wrong place, which wouldn’t have been great.</p>
                            <p>Some of the views were absolutely spectacular! Unfortunately, many of them were on the other side of the bus and so I couldn’t really get as many pictures as I’d have liked. We stopped off at the Liverpool Restaurant (as in the football club). The packed lunch was the same again. It was generally fine, but the chicken was mostly bone and the chocolate had melted.</p>
                            <p>We then continued and headed up the mountains. The views got better and better. We arrived at the camp after an eight-hour journey. All of the previous camps I’ve grown to like, whereas this one I love straight away. I’m in a dorm again with 11 others (seven Year 12s and four Year 11s). There is a viewing platform which has an indescribable view over the local area. There are also trampolines and swings. It’s definitely a change from previous camps.</p>
                            <h5>9pm</h5>
                            <p>I spent some more time at the viewing platform. Ian has described the view as one of the best ever – quite the compliment coming from him! We then went for tea, and it’s self-service and so we can choose what we want. I’ve had rice, beef, broccoli, tomato and cucumber – and it’s probably the best food yet.</p>
                            <p>We then had a presentation from Herman: one of the camp owners. He talked about how the camp could help to improve the local community, and why developing countries struggle. There were also some interesting statistics in the presentation, many of which were quite shocking. For example, the average European earns $100 per day, whereas the average Tanzanian earns just $2.</p>
                            <p>After the presentation finished, we were given some information about the trek. We’re now doing only two days rather than three. But, in some ways, I’m glad because I think I’d have struggled otherwise. That said, I’d like to have seen the sights. After that, I went down to the viewing area to see the stars. Apparently, we’re not supposed to, but nobody told me directly so I did it anyway. It was worth it. The lights across the landscape and stars were beautiful. I then sat on the swing on my way back and had a little me-time. Now I just need a good night’s sleep!</p>

                            <h5>7am</h5>
                            <p>Last night wasn’t great. It started off fine with us all joking around (the lads had me doing various Jeremy Clarkson impressions because apparently, I sound like him), but it just went on and I wanted some sleep. There was also a minor accident which kept me up most of the night, but I think that’s now sorted.</p>
                            <p>We all woke up at 6am to see the sunrise, but sadly it’s a cloudy morning and we didn’t see much of it. Having said that, the view above the clouds is incredible and was well worth it. I’ve proposed that we do the same each morning. Breakfast is at 8am, giving me plenty of time to get myself sorted now.</p>
                            <h5>2:30pm</h5>
                            <p>I’ve been through my clothes and I should be able to get away without doing any more washing. I just need to be a bit creative. I then went back to the viewing point and got ready for the day with a nice view. Ian then came down for a look and I spent some time chatting to him. In the hour or so I was there, the clouds moved over and formed a sheet over the entire area. It’s a strange feeling being above the clouds like that.</p>
                            <p>Breakfast was then served at 8am and there was a selection of food – some of it nice and some of it not. Then, at 9am, we set off on our trek. It initially was downhill all the way, but soon started to go back up again. The uphill parts were really hard, but I enjoyed it. It was extremely foggy and sometimes rainy which meant we missed out on some of the views, but it really added to the atmosphere. There were many sheer drops when we had no idea how far down each was or what was down there. It did make some great pictures though.</p>
                            <p>When we got back, we got changed and went for dinner. Again, there was a selection. I had carrots, rice and beans. The carrots tasted a bit weird but, on the whole, it was a nice meal. We now have the afternoon to ourselves, and I’ve got no idea what to do with it!</p>
                            <h5>8pm</h5>
                            <p>During and after the trek, *** had a little bit of a meltdown, which also caused *** to have a bit of a meltdown. Fantastic. So, I spent a lot of time doing my best to help, but of course there’s only so much I can do.</p>
                            <p>The rest of the afternoon has ended up being dead time. Half of my dorm ended up sleeping and some people went down to play football. Apparently, the local team had a scheduled game which about 200 locals had come to watch. Had I have known that would happen, I’d have gone down. But anyway, I had a relaxed afternoon listening to my music and reading.</p>
                            <p>It was then tea time, and tonight I had spaghetti with beef. It was alright, but not a favourite. I then filled my water bottle, and on my way back saw a group heading down the path. I assumed they were going to the viewpoint and so went down myself. That didn’t end well. There was only me there, and the dense fog and rustling around me made it a rather scary experience.</p>
                            <p>Tomorrow, I’m hoping the fog will have lifted so I can catch a sunrise. I’m looking forward to the trek tomorrow (apparently a lot of it is downhill), but would have liked some more snacks. The shop here doesn’t have anything I really fancy. Above all, what I really need to get is a good night’s sleep to make up for last night. I’ve been out stargazing (as best as possible given the fog) to get relaxed. The only problem is *** is playing on my mind...</p>

                            <h5>6:30am</h5>
                            <p>My plan from last night about getting a good night’s sleep didn’t go particularly well. The light in our dorm can flicker on when it’s turned off and it’s caused absolute pandemonium (especially thanks to ***). Once this was finished, it turned into picking on *** and other various things. About 10:45pm, I snapped and then everyone started on me. Eventually, about 11:15pm, everyone was quiet – but it still took me a while to get to sleep because of how annoyed I was.</p>
                            <p>Despite that, I was up at 6am this morning to see the sunrise and this time it was clear. It happened much faster than I expected, but it was beautiful to watch. While I get ready and await the trek, I’m just going to watch the clouds move over.</p>
                            <h5>4:30pm</h5>
                            <p>Breakfast this morning was almost identical to yesterday – the only difference being that there was watermelon instead of bananas. At 9am, we set off on our trek. This one was further afield, and so we were driven to it.</p>
                            <p>The walk lasted for around seven hours and was mainly through a rainforest. Considering where we were, there was very little life on display. There were however, some incredible views on show. The terrain was also much more challenging, much more narrow, steep and slippery.</p>
                            <p>We stopped by a waterfall for a break and I skidded down a rock towards the water. Thankfully, Miss Largey managed to get hold of me and Jack pulled me up. Then, immediately afterwards, I did the exact same thing – but managed to smooth it over by acting like I’d just sat down.</p>
                            <p>Despite this and several other minor accidents, I’ve got no noticeable injuries. Jack offered some great entertainment by getting overconfident dancing along and falling over, as well as smacking his head on a tree when he wasn’t looking where he was going. Miss Mason also was very entertaining with her reactions to precarious situations.</p>
                            <p>Dinner was brought out to us at 2pm. We had a mix of pumpkin yam (whatever that is), and sweet potatoes. A variety of veg was available and I had carrots. Luke also got me a banana, but someone managed to pick the one unsafe to eat. It was hard to eat as there were two children looking on. As we had more, more and more children came. We had two dogs with us called Weary and Kim (both Tanzanian golden retrievers) and the children appeared to be quite scared of them.</p>
                            <p>After dinner was done, we headed back to the buses. The terrain was much nicer for this part and it took about an hour. We then headed back to camp. I’ve charged my camera batteries and MP3 player for the journey tomorrow. All that remains for me to do is to have a shower and get packed up. Also, I want to try and see the stars from the viewing platform – just hoping it stays clear!</p>
                            <h5>8pm</h5>
                            <p>I managed to get in the shower straight away. It wasn’t as cold as I expected; it was much colder. Anyway, it needed doing. I then had a go on the trampoline. My plan was to do some sort of flip. Given my track record for accidents, it’s probably a good thing that I realised I’m too old for that sort of thing.</p>
                            <p>It was then tea time. I had rice with beef, which was alright. I’ve also got all my things packed and am ready to go. Tonight, I’m going to try and do some stargazing. It’s strange to think I’m on my way to my final camp tomorrow. Where does the time go?</p>

                            <h5>7:30am</h5>
                            <p>Well, here I am at day 20 – now nearly three weeks since this trip started. Last night I went down to the viewing platform for another amazing view. The stars and moon were out and there were pockets of light across the landscape. I spent about an hour and a half out there – the majority of which was having a deep chat with Harry about the experience as a whole.</p>
                            <p>I pretty much went straight to bed back at the dorm afterwards and went to sleep soon after that. This morning, most of us were up at 5:45am to have a look at the sunrise. It was cloudy again, but still well worth it. I also took some pictures from around camp and am now ready to go.</p>
                            <h5>7:30pm</h5>
                            <p>Breakfast this morning was almost identical… again. We were back to bananas again this time. I made sure to have a big breakfast given the journey today. Once that was cleared away, I paid my bar tab and went for one final look from the viewing platform. I even blew it a kiss!</p>
                            <p>We then set off. The first part of the journey wasn’t great. I think a lot of it was to do with me realising that I wouldn’t see that view again. Also, Ben decided that it would be a good idea (despite me saying that it’s a bad idea) to stack everyone’s food on the bag shelf. With each bump and adverse camber, they moved closer to the edge. Inevitably, one of them eventually fell off. Thankfully, I’d taken mine back beforehand and mine wasn’t ruined. Annoyingly, *** refused to accept any responsibility for it! This was the second case of that in the day; in the morning, someone had snapped a broom but nobody would own up to it, which delayed us setting off.</p>
                            <p>Anyway, once we got onto the highway, things improved. We stopped off for dinner at quite a nice place, and I even treated myself to a KitKat and some ice cream. Back on the road, it felt like I was on a luxury holiday. I had the window fully open; the sun was out, the sky was blue and the clouds were frequent. It was a beautiful atmosphere and I think I’ve got some good pictures from it.</p>
                            <p>We were also stopped by the police four times during the journey. Surprisingly, they didn’t notice Miss Mason shouting “seatbelts!” each time. After an eight-hour journey, we made it to Tanga! At a glance, it’s beautiful. There is a lovely beach view from the seating area. I’m looking forward to seeing a sunrise from it. However, as we were given our briefing, I was less keen. There are many rules, which are difficult to keep track of. ***, the Camp Liaison Manager, seems a little stern.</p>
                            <p>My tent has five other people, and we have to hold our big bags too. I’ve come up with a solution to the bag problem, but we don’t have much space… again. We’ve also already had an ant problem. Tea was nice, on a more positive note. We had rice, pasta and beef.</p>
                            <p>But, overall, I’m having another wobble. As I’ve previously written here, I often start off sceptical but by the time I’m leaving I love it. I’m hoping this will be the same again. It’s just a shame that a good day has ended like this. This is of course my last camp and I’ve only got four days here. I would like to end on a good note. I don’t think it helped that I woke up at 4am. Ian has given me some ear plugs to hopefully stop that.</p>
                            <p>I’m going to watch the beach volleyball for a bit (I’m sure Dad would joke about that if he knew that’s what I was doing), get my things ready for the morning and then get an early night.</p>

                            <h5>8:45am</h5>
                            <p>I found a crab last night on the way to my tent, hiding under a shell. That was unexpected. I didn't sleep particularly badly last night, but not particularly well either. I had another "doxycycline dream", which kept me up from the early hours.</p>
                            <p>Breakfast was at 7:30 this morning, and I had cornflakes. I went back to the tent to get ready, and found only long pants (it's way too hot for that). But Bayley had a great idea of using my swimwear.</p>
                            <p>We're going out for a look around the village this morning, and I'm quite looking forward to it. I'll also do some sunbathing later, for the first time. The tan is really showing now!</p>
                            <h5>12:45pm</h5>
                            <p>The walk into the village this morning was quite eye opening. James, the Project Manager, began by telling us a bit about it. Some of the people in the village work at Camp Tanga. The cooks, for example, work every day from 3am to 9pm. At the end of the month, they will be paid about 150,000 TZS. That is about £50 for the month, working out at around 5000-7000 TZS per day.</p>
                            <p>He also told us about the projects. Previous groups have just finished a mud house for an elderly blind man who is desperately ill. We will be working on a house for a lady who is too poor to cope and will have to leave the village to live with her married daughter otherwise. </p>
                            <p>James also explained that another ongoing project is a new primary school. This will replace the existing one, which will be turned into a secondary school (there currently isn't one). Many girls here become mothers at 18, and it is hoped that this will change with better education. On that note, they are also hoping to build a hospital and/or medical stock as the nearest hospital is 90 minutes away and difficult to access as nobody has a car. Consequently, many die giving birth. The things James told us were very moving, and as I had a walk around, I had a little cry under my sunglasses.</p>
                            <p>We were given the chance to try fresh coconut (so fresh you watch them climb the tree to get it). They use rope under their feet to climb - nothing else. I wasn't keen on either the milk or the flesh. It wasn't disgusting, but I couldn't finish it. The village is very reliant on the trees. The oil is used for cooking, the leaves for roofing (even though it can easily rot), and the wood for construction.</p>
                            <p>Finally, we went to the market. I bought some more presents (after lots of bargaining) and then we headed back. Some of the children followed us around. Bayley and I kept swinging one for about 5 minutes. Back at camp, the tide is in and the water is clear. It looks inviting and apparently is very warm, so I'm going to give it a go after dinner.</p>
                            <h5>4:30pm</h5>
                            <p>Dinner today was rice with veg. Despite being bland, it was good and I finished it all. I then changed into my swimwear and went into the sea. It was warm and very salty. I spent the most part playing volleyball and attempted several stunts such as overhead kicks (which didn't go down particularly well). I also attempted to walk further out to sea, but there is lots of coral underfoot, making it quite painful, so I gave up on that.</p>
                            <p>I decided to get out a little early to dry off, which was definitely a good move since I forgot my towel. We were then introduced to our afternoon project: turning flip-flops which have washed up on the beach into keyrings. We were making turtles. First, we had to choose two flip-flops, cut out a turtle shape using a template and then glue the two together to give a multi-colour effect. We then carve out the shape, which I needed a lot of help to do since I made a hash of it. I thought we had to sand it down before carving, but that actually just ruined the shape. I then sanded the carved model and attempted to create the fins but again struggled. Art has never been my thing. But, I've got something finished, unlike most people who gave up and went back to the beach. I also bought a finished turtle and a doorstop because I quite liked them.</p>
                            <p>I have to say, this camp has definitely become better for me after I was sceptical last night. Tomorrow was supposed to be a project day, but it is now an additional R&R day. In the morning, we will be doing a beach walk outside of our assigned boundary. This will only take around 90 minutes, giving us some relaxation time. In the afternoon, we can choose to play/watch football with the locals. I'll be going to watch.</p>
                            <p>I also want to do some sunbathing. I had a go this afternoon but the sun is too far along. Tonight, I need to do some repacking and may even get a shower in. I'd also like to stay out and watch the stars. I think I'll also try and catch the sunrise in the morning!</p>
                            <h5>8:30pm</h5>
                            <p>I managed to have my bucket shower, and it was the best one yet. This one is fitted with a shower head, which makes a huge difference. I now no longer smell of salt. Also, after much frustration, I got everything repacked. I then went out on to the beach and watched the volleyball and people rock pooling while just generally contemplating life.</p>
                            <p>Tea tonight was rice with beef and veg. It was alright, not my favourite or least favourite. After tea, *** had a bit of a breakdown. He said he wanted some alone time and so I left him be and did some stargazing. The moon is visible throughout the day here, but it was so bright tonight and there were so many stars out.</p>
                            <p>I had a nice chat with Mr Carty during this. It started off being about physics, stars and space - and then it moved onto the trip in general. One of the things that came up was my part in the petition against children being caned. He said he was very proud of my part in it. Apparently, Sharon also said that I should do public speaking on behalf of people (on the back of politics back at home right now). I also said about my initial dislike of this camp and it turns out that many people were in the same boat - which of course is reassuring.</p>
                            <p>I've now come to bed early ahead of getting up to see the sunrise and seeing off the other group (they wake up at 5:15am!). With only three more "meaningful days", it's important to make every hour count!</p>

                            <h5>6:45am</h5>
                            <p>We had a bit of a beetle problem in the tent last night - which particularly bothered Bayley. It took quite a while for everyone to settle down, and so I didn't sleep particularly well last night. Even though we were planning on seeing the sunrise at 6am, I still woke up much earlier. The sky was cloudy, which made the sunrise quite difficult to see. I think I'll have to try again for the next few mornings.</p>
                            <p>There are loads of insects and flies around this morning, continually attacking me. My plan for this morning is to have a read of my book on the beach before breakfast is served. We've got lots of free time today, so things should be pretty relaxed.</p>
                            <h5>11:30am</h5>
                            <p>Breakfast this morning was quite varied - I started off with cornflakes but then moved on to a couple of omelettes. We then went out on our beach walk, and saw several things: sea cucumbers, hermit crabs, eels, sea urchins and starfish - all of which but the eel and crab I held. We also had some time on the "secret beach", which is only accessible when the tide is out, and then walked back via the hotel here.  While posing for a picture, I smacked my head on a roof of coral: a typical "me accident", but it still hurt.</p>
                            <p>I've spent the rest of the morning sunbathing. I very nearly burned while on the walk, but I think I've gotten away with it. It has been a bit too cloudy and we've just had a shower lasting for 30 or so seconds. It's quite relaxing though!</p>
                            <h5>5:30pm</h5>
                            <p>The sunbathing has gone wrong! I've burned on the back of both my hands, the back of my left elbow and on my right ankle. It's not good. I've tried continually reapplying sun cream and it's getting better, but it still stings. I also went into the water for a bit, with the intention of keeping my clothes dry. That plan went well right until Ethan Taylor rugby tackled me into the water. I did it back later and somehow cut my left hand. What an accident-prone day I'm having!</p>
                            <p>Dinner today was chapatis and beans. It's bland, but I enjoyed it. We then went down on a very long walk (about an hour) to play football. I decided not to play but instead watched from the side-lines. I was in fear of getting the runs since I've had an upset stomach, but that seems to have resolved itself (thankfully). The other bad news is that my day bag is broken (again), so I'm going to attempt to fix that later.</p>
                            <p>Mr Carty has suggested that we should do something for Ian and Tim on the last night. We have an idea, but I'd like to be able to at least suggest an alternative. I'd also like it if we could do something for the teachers. Perhaps I'll think about it while stargazing tonight.</p>
                            <p>The walk back also took a while. I had a nice chat with Mr Lawton about his refereeing and sport in general. We also got a bit lost in the village. Tea tonight is octopus Bolognese. I'm not sure how that'll be...</p>
                            <h5>8:30pm</h5>
                            <p>The octopus and seafood Bolognese wasn't too bad. I wouldn't order it at a restaurant though. Another group has joined camp and have been made to eat with us. This has massively reduced space, so much so that I ended up on the staff table tonight. After tea, I fixed my day bag and sat on the beach and had a chat with Lewis about several things.</p>
                            <p>Tomorrow will be our last project day of the expedition. I'm also near halfway through my time at Tanga. Soon, it'll be Keys and then home. The girls from the other group are all screaming because there's a snake in their tent (apparently). This could be a long night for us all...</p>

                            <h5>6pm</h5>
                            <p>As predicted, last night was a long night - but not because of the girls in the next tent. I had another "doxycycline dream" which woke me up at 5am. Then at 5:30am, Jack needed to get out and stood on my foot in the process. Thankfully, it wasn't the burned foot (if it had been, I've have screamed loud enough to wake up the whole camp). Ethan Taylor's alarm went off at 7:13am (I have no idea why he chose that time) and breakfast was at 7:30am as usual. I was hoping for omelettes but instead I was on the cornflakes again. Fruit is offered each morning, but I keep noticing flies on it and so never bother.</p>
                            <p>After breakfast, we headed down to the village to do our project work. Today we worked on the mud house. My first job was being part of a chain removing coral from the floor. The lady who will live here had put it in (or had someone put it in) to try and help us but had in fact hindered us. I enjoyed this job. I was working with Ian, Jack and Matt - which was very entertaining. It also wasn't too straining.</p>
                            <p>I was later reassigned to "plastering" an exterior wall. I didn't like this as much. Progress was slow and it was difficult to master, but I had a go. I then had a go mixing the mud and transporting it in wheelbarrows, which I struggled with. Today was very hot and humid, and it really affected me. We also worked for a long time (three and a half hours) on top of the walk to the village.</p>
                            <p>I then briefly went back to moving coral, before we walked into the village centre for dinner. I kept nearly falling through my chair as it a huge crack on it. Today we had burgers and chips (hallelujah!). I had high expectations and they turned out to be a little bit too high. It was still nice though.</p>
                            <p>At 2pm we returned to the project site and I continued moving the coral. We got another chain going (also involving some local children) and we got our bit cleared. I then went back to "plastering", which went a bit better this time. I also got roped into mixing, which again tired me out.</p>
                            <p>Harry needed the toilet at this point, and since we must go in pairs I offered to go along with him to give myself a break. On the way back, people at the market tried to get us to buy things. I hadn't taken any money anyway, so I couldn't have if I wanted to (I didn't). We also heard the Mosque's call to player, which was quite nice to listen to. By the time we got back to the project site, it was packing up time. I had missed a mud fight, which I'm glad about because I was already filthy at this point.</p>
                            <p>Then we headed back. I had a chat with Mr Carty about travelling. This trip has really opened my eyes about it. When we got back, we had planned to go in the sea. Everyone awkwardly stood in a line not wanting to be the first to go in. Then I ditched my hat, glasses and bag and jumped in. It was very refreshing, but I realised when I got out that I'd left my camera in my pocket. Oops! I've got the batteries and SD card in a bucket of rice. I'm going to leave it there overnight and hope it's all okay (especially the card!).</p>
                            <p>I've had a shower and am now on the beach waiting for my tea. There is a crab which keeps coming out of the sand next to me before running back in. If only I could get a picture. I might have accidentally signed myself and Luke up to being team leaders tomorrow. I actually wouldn't mind. My plan for tonight is to just spend an hour or so under the stars and then return to the tent early.</p>
                            <h5>9pm</h5>
                            <p>Tea tonight was chicken stir-fry. It was actually quite nice and I finished it all. We sat down in a different area tonight and it was nice to be in a quiet area with people that I knew. After tea, Ian took us out onto the beach and did the briefing as usual. Afterwards, he asked us to silently reflect on our time here. He talked us through it and then left us to do so individually. I was one of the last ones to go. Even as I write this, I'm listening only to the sound of the sea - whereas normally I'm listening to music. It was a really powerful and emotional time. It really allowed me to relive the whole experience from start to present - much like when I reread these notes.</p>
                            <p>On another note, Ian has received a response following our anti-caning petition. Peter has spoken to the headteacher, who says that he regrets that we feel the way that we do - but that it's an important tool used for discipline. It's not the perfect response, but it's a good place to start. We'll be meeting Peter in Moshi and so Ethan and I will now need to think of a response to that.</p>
                            <p>Tomorrow is our last proper day here, which is strange to think about. That means I need to get my packing done ideally tomorrow instead of at Keys. As much as I've loved this trip, I'm ready to go home now. Tomorrow morning we're going to do some cooking in the village. I'd quite like to see the sunrise too. After that, the day is our own...</p>

                            <h5>8am</h5>
                            <p>Last night wasn’t particularly eventful. I woke up early once again, and got up around 7am. The first task today was attempt to fix my camera. Once I’d (eventually) got all of the rice out, I put in a new battery and SD card, but no luck. It’s completely bricked. However, I’ve put the original SD card in Harry’s camera and everything is still there - which is a relief.</p>
                            <p>Breakfast this morning was scrambled egg and toast for me – which was okay, but I prefer the omelettes. We’re off out making chapatis in the village, so I’m just waiting for everyone to be ready before we set off.</p>
                            <h5>1:30pm</h5>
                            <p>The walk to the village felt as far as usual. We started off making mandazis. We had to kneed the dough at which point it is cut into four pieces and we repeat the process. This is then rolled flat, before being cut into quarters. We then started on the chapatis, which is a similar process although it is cut into strips and not quarters. I sat this part out to give other people a turn.</p>
                            <p>We then had to cook them. I found this part particularly hard when doing the mandazis for the first time (I ended up going twice because some people couldn’t be bothered!). I splashed cooking oil on my knee at one point. The finished products were very nice.</p>
                            <p>There was another fight involving *** today – this time with ***. The consequences of that are still to be determined. Dinner today was pizza (vegetable pizza, of course) with chips. Things seem to suddenly be looking up. We now have to get packed up this afternoon. We’ve been given the option to leave clothes, but mine are a disgrace so I think I’ll donate them locally at home after cleaning them.</p>
                            <p>Our travel shirts have been checked to ensure they’re clean and don’t smell. I’ve managed to get mine approved, despite the fact I didn’t even wash it! The only downside is everyone is now packing in the same place and so there’s not much room.</p>
                            <h5>6pm</h5>
                            <p>Well, I’ve now packed up for the final time. I’ve got everything that I’ll need at Keys and on the flight in my day bag, so I’m pretty much ready to go. I went down onto the beach and jumped over some waves. Unfortunately, my shoes and socks got a bit wet and sandy in the process. I’ve replaced the socks and washed the shoes. I’m just hoping the shoes will be dry in the morning. I wasn’t planning on going in the sea, but of course ended up in there – playing beach volleyball, floating around, swimming, etc. I’ve had an afternoon snack of cinnamon buns, which were really nice. Now I’m just waiting for tea: vegetable Bolognese. Yay...</p>
                            <h5>8pm</h5>
                            <p>The vegetable Bolognese wasn’t great. I pretty much only had the spaghetti. It’s not what I’d have liked for a last meal. Afterwards, we had a slightly longer briefing since it’ll likely be our last. I had tried talking my way into being team leader tomorrow as I’d like to do the final student speech. Sadly, it didn’t work. On the note of student speeches, *** addressed the group to apologise for the fight earlier. Credit where it’s due, that takes a lot to do. Also, someone from the other group wished us luck, which was a nice gesture.</p>
                            <p>We then had to fill out an evaluation form. I put almost all positive responses. In hindsight, I wish I’d have mentioned the food being repetitive. But on the whole, Camps and West Hill have been incredible with this. We were then dismissed and I’ve come back to the beach for one last look at the stars. It’s cloudy, but still worth coming out for.</p>
                            <p>Unfortunately, my shoes haven’t dried, but I’ll deal with that tomorrow. It’s strange that tomorrow my journey home begins. I’m ready, but I’m going to miss this. Breakfast tomorrow is at 6:15am, so hopefully I’ll see the sunrise here at last. I regret not going out to see it earlier in the week. Hopefully I sleep well tonight. I really need it.</p>

                            <h5>6pm</h5>
                            <p>Last night was absolutely awful. There seemed to be some sort of concert going on somewhere nearby and the bass really carried. Also, someone got up in the night and didn’t Velcro the tent up properly. It then started really raining, and loads came in and splashed my face. All of this led to a really bad night’s sleep.</p>
                            <p>We got up at 6am for breakfast. I had a lot of cornflakes ahead of the long journey, and finally saw the sunrise. I wish I could have gotten some pictures. Plenty of other people did though so I’ll ask to be sent them.</p>
                            <p>At 7:30am, we set off on the journey. Pretty quickly, we were stopped by the police who were checking passports. Two of our group hadn’t had theirs stamped and we were threatened with a $1200 (about 2.5 million TZS) fine. Someone managed to resolve the issue, but it delayed us by half an hour.</p>
                            <p>The majority of the journey was spent listening to Bayley’s and Jack’s music on a Bluetooth Speaker. Usually, I use my own music, but didn’t bother today. The music, hot weather, blue sky and 15 other people really made it an enjoyable experience. For this reason, the journey went pretty quickly.</p>
                            <p>Annoyingly, the driver made several stops and we were stopped by the police twice more – both delaying us further. We stopped off for dinner at a place we’ve been to before. I had a marmalade sandwich (which I didn’t like much), a cake, a butter sandwich and a mandazi. I also bought a KitKat as well. While having dinner, I very nearly lost my MP3 player, which would have been bad!</p>
                            <p>Back on the road, Jack asked me to read his notes. They’re really good, and reading them allowed me to relive many experiences. At around 4:30pm, we arrived in Moshi and went souvenir shopping again. I bought four shot glasses (which, for legal reasons, aren’t for me).</p>
                            <p>Then, at 5pm, we arrived at Keys. I’m in the same room and same bed as last time. This time I’m with Ethan and Bayley. At 7pm, we’re having pizza. I’ve ordered ham, since ham and pineapple isn’t an option. Then, I’ll be going to bed and trying to sleep until around 1am. I don’t think it’ll happen, but I’ll try. I’m all packed and ready to go, and I’ve had a shower to make myself look more presentable. I’m really looking forward to this meal!</p>

                            <h5>6pm</h5>
                            <p>The pizza last night was so good. It was definitely a well needed and well deserved change. It even came with chips! Afterwards, we each went around and gave a good memory of Ian and Tim as a thank you. My memory for Ian was him being able to answer all of the cultural questions that I continually come up with and for Tim it was watching him dive around while playing volleyball.</p>
                            <p>Ian, Tim and all the staff gave a speech to say their thank yous and to close the trip. Mr Lawton also mentioned about volunteers to talk about the trip and to help with DofE so I think I’ll look into it. All in all, it was quite an emotional evening. We then had a Year 12 picture on my room’s balcony, which was a pain to organise since people kept going missing. Given how dark it was, it probably wasn’t worth it (I’ve not seen the picture yet).</p>
                            <p>Afterwards, I went to bed. At this point, it was probably around 8:30pm. However, I was still awake after 10pm because of various other things going on. Firstly, Bayley wanted a shower – which is fair enough. What really did it was that ***, ***, *** and *** went to join *** on the balcony, which really kept me up. Eventually, they left and I locked all the doors so Bayley and I could sleep.</p>
                            <p>We were woken up at 1:30am and were off to the airport by about 2am. The journey was shorter than what I’d expected and remember; we got there about 3am. I changed my Tanzanian Shillings back into dollars (keeping one of each note as a souvenir), and then we started checking in. The queue was huge because there was so many of us and only one working x-ray machine.</p>
                            <p>I got told off when handing over my hold luggage because I’d left the camera in there and was later made to empty my day bag because I didn’t declare my toiletries bottles. By the time this was over, it was 5am and we began boarding and 5:30am, - so the wait wasn’t too bad.</p>
                            <p>On the flight, I managed to get a window seat thanks to a kind stranger. I saw the sunrise and watched as the lights of Tanzania faded away. I began watching The Penguins of Madagascar to pass the time, but after half an hour started with a really bad headache. I tried sleeping it off, which didn’t happen. After I’d eaten breakfast (I have no idea what it was, but it was good!), it started to go away.</p>
                            <p>I also watched Avengers: Endgame – which is a three-hour film. Over both films, I probably cried around seven times – the worst one being right before an air hostess offered me a cake and I had to hide behind a cushion to pull myself together. I think a lot of it is excitement for being home tonight.</p>
                            <p>We landed at Istanbul at 12:40pm and taxied for what felt like years. In the time between getting off that flight and onto this second flight, my bag was searched three times and my passport and boarding pass checked five times. I’ve also had a body search. It all seemed a bit extreme considering I’d already had two bag searches in Tanzania. By the time we got to the gate, we had about 15 minutes before boarding.</p>
                            <p>This flight so far has been pretty similar. I haven’t put on any films, only music. Again, I’ve had a headache and this time have had two paracetamol tablets. I’ve tried sleeping, but again with no luck. I’m at the window again and have been looking down at the cities below. This plane also has a camera pointing down, which I can access from my screen. We’re just coming up to the English Channel, and I’m excited to see England and London again.</p>
                            <p>I’m not too bothered about the journey home; I just want to get it over with now. We’re due to land at 4:30pm. Let’s hope our hold luggage makes it this time…</p>
                            <h5>9pm (BST)</h5>
                            <p>The rest of the plane journey went smoothly. We passed through customs without any issues and were soon on our way out. We said goodbye to Tim, who is getting another flight to Glasgow, and then went to our coach.</p>
                            <p>The atmosphere is grey, wet and miserable – so British, in other words. I love it. The journey hasn’t been particularly interesting so far. There hasn’t been much to see, and the music hasn’t been great on the speaker. We’re currently stopped at a service station and I’ve been to Burger King for some tea. It’s extortionate in price, but well worth it. We’ve got about two hours to go. I’m looking forward to being back so much!</p>
                            <h5>11:30pm (BST)</h5>
                            <p>The rest of the coach journey was an absolute party. I was too tired to care and really let myself go – dancing around. We also sang the “We Love You” song for each of the teachers, Ian and other random things, and also did Country Roads once more time. We arrived back at West Hill at 10:45pm and after saying my goodbyes, headed home.</p>
                            <p>This marked the end of this expedition. I’ve seen some amazing things and some heart-breaking things. There have been good days and tough days. There have been laughs and tears. But what I’m sure of is that I have no regrets about taking part in what has truly been the adventure of a lifetime.</p>
